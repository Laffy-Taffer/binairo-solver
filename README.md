# Binairo Solver
Reads and solves puzzles from https://www.puzzle-binairo.com/ using python

1. Ensure you have night mode enabled on the site (or replace the reference squares with their day mode counterparts)
2. Take a screenshot of the puzzle, crop it down to the puzzle itself and save it to puzzle.jpg
3. Run solver.py

The script will print the text version of the puzzle before and after solving, as well as printing images of the puzzle's progress to the Progress folder. That all is stuff for my own sanity in case things break.

Additionally, the script does not input the solution back onto the website. I did that in part because I'm lazy but also to resist the urge to break the leaderboards of the site.
